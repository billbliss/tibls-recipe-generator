# üìù Tibls Recipe Conversion Prompt

Convert any provided recipe (from a URL, PDF, or image) into valid Tibls JSON as described below.

---

## ‚úÖ Required Behavior Summary
- Always extract or generate all required Tibls fields.
- Strictly validate output JSON against the Tibls schema.
- Always include a concise `summary` for each recipe, generated if necessary.
- If any field is missing or unclear, supplement from visible content or generate a suitable value and add a note to `notes[]`.

---

## üì• Step 1: Source Type Handling

**If given a URL:**
- Extract JSON-LD data (Schema.org `Recipe`) if available.
- Prefer `og:image` (or `twitter:image`) as the recipe image if it's a clear food photo; otherwise, heuristically select a main food photo.
- Parse structured data into Tibls JSON, supplementing missing fields from page content or metadata.
- If summary or other required fields are missing, generate them and add a note to `notes[]`.

### 1a: Metadata Extraction from `<head>`

When extracting metadata from a webpage:

- Always parse the `<head>` section in addition to the `<body>`.
- Specifically extract `<meta property="og:image" content="...">`.
  - If present and the `content` value is a valid absolute URL pointing to an image (`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png`, `.webp`), use it as the value of `ogImageUrl`.
  - Do not guess or synthesize `ogImageUrl` based on known domain patterns; only use values explicitly found in the page metadata or structured data.
- If no valid `og:image` tag is found and the JSON-LD data also lacks a valid `"image"` field:
  - Set `ogImageUrl` to `null` or omit it entirely.
  - Add a note to `notes[]`:
    ```json
    { "text": "No og:image or JSON-LD image found; ogImageUrl left unset." }
    ```

If multiple `og:image` tags are present, prefer the first valid one.

This step ensures the image metadata is reliable and prevents hallucinated values from being used.

### üì• Step 1b: Handling Full HTML Input

If the user input includes a full HTML document (e.g., prefixed with "HTML source for https://example.com"):
	‚Ä¢	Parse both the <head> and <body> sections.
	‚Ä¢	Extract metadata from <meta> tags in the <head>, including:
	‚Ä¢	og:image ‚Üí ogImageUrl
	‚Ä¢	og:title (for validation only)
	‚Ä¢	Set the following fields in the Tibls JSON:
	‚Ä¢	urlSource = full URL provided
	‚Ä¢	urlHost = domain extracted from URL (e.g., example.com)
	‚Ä¢	Do not guess these values ‚Äî only populate them if the input includes either:
	‚Ä¢	A valid https://... URL on its own
	‚Ä¢	Or full HTML source that includes such a URL

If input includes an HTML block prefixed with HTML source for https://..., treat that as the canonical origin of all content and metadata, including urlSource, urlHost, and ogImageUrl.

**If given a PDF or image:**
- Use OCR to extract text if needed.
- Identify and segment: title, ingredients, instructions, time values, servings, and metadata.
- Use a clear photo of the dish as `ogImageUrl` if present.
- Always generate a `summary` (based on visible context or inferred tone) and include it.
- Note any OCR ambiguity, handwritten notes, or extra metadata in `notes[]`.

## üßÆ Step 2: Calorie Estimation (Always Include)

Always include a top-level `calories` field.

- If the recipe includes a stated calorie count, use it.
- If not, estimate total calories using typical values for raw ingredients:
  1. Group by ingredient type (e.g., flour, butter, sugar, eggs).
  2. Estimate based on standard raw ingredient values.
  3. Round to the nearest 100 kcal.
  4. Add a `notes[]` entry summarizing the estimate.

- If calorie estimation is not feasible (e.g., insufficient detail or ambiguous quantities):
  - Set `calories: 0` (never use `null`)
  - Add a note explaining why estimation was skipped

This ensures the `calories` field is always present and explicitly defined.

---

## üì¶ Step 3: Tibls JSON Construction

Each recipe object must include:
- `@type`: `"https://tibls.app/types/recipe"`
- `id`: Unique UUID string
- `name`: Recipe title
- `ingredients[]`: Array of ingredient objects
- `steps[]`: Array of step objects
- `summary`: Concise overview (always present)
- `calories`: Always include, even if it's 0

**Optional fields:**  
`urlSource`, `urlHost`, `created`, `updated`, `lastCooked`, `lastQueued`, `cookCount`, `prepTime`, `cookTime`, `totalTime`, `servings`, `ogImageUrl`, `notes[]`

**Notes:**
- If any required field is missing, extract or generate it and explain in `notes[]`.
- If calorie count is missing, estimate it (see Step 3) and add a note.
- Always include a `notes[]` entry for any inferred, estimated, or post-processed value.

---

## üë®‚Äçüç≥ Step 4: Ingredient Handling

Each ingredient:
```json
{ "text": "2 cups flour", "sectionHeader": "Dough" }
```
- Always include `sectionHeader`; only the first in a group gets a value, others get `""`.
- Use original units, with alternates in parentheses if appropriate.

---

## üç≥ Step 5: Step Handling

Each step:
```json
{ "text": "Bake for 30 minutes at 350¬∞F.", "sectionHeader": "Bake", "time": 1800 }
```
- Use `sectionHeader` only on the first step of a group.
- If a step includes a time range, use the lower bound and add a note.
- For per-side or flipping instructions with a total time, set `time` to the full duration and add `flipTime` (half of total, rounded).
- Add a note to `notes[]` when `flipTime` is inferred.

---

## üìù Notes

Always include notes for:
- JSON-LD usage and post-processing
- Timing ranges or approximations
- OCR or image scanning
- Calorie estimation (if performed)
- Any inferred, estimated, or supplemented field

Example:
```json
"notes": [
  { "text": "Summary inferred from page content as none was provided." },
  { "text": "Time range of 35‚Äì45 minutes given; used 35 minutes." }
]
```

---

## ‚úÖ Final Validation

- Ensure all required fields are present and valid per the Tibls JSON Schema.
- Do not include `"time"` in a step unless it is meaningful.
- All time fields: `prepTime`, `cookTime`, and `totalTime` in minutes (integers); step `time`/`flipTime` in seconds (integers).
- No `null`, `undefined`, or placeholder values.
- If any value is generated or inferred, explain in `notes[]`.
- Output must be strictly valid JSON and fully conform to the schema.

---

## üîñ Final Output Checklist

Before returning the Tibls JSON, ensure the following:

- All required fields are present:
  - `@type`
  - `id`
  - `name`
  - `ingredients`
  - `steps`
  - `summary`
  - `calories`
- `calories` is always included:
  - Estimated if possible
  - Set to `0` if not estimable, with an explanatory note in `notes[]`
- `notes[]` includes entries for all inferred, estimated, or post-processed values

Failure to include these fields will result in invalid output.
